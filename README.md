# Ambig

![](https://github.com/ryanzzff/ambig-swiftui/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

An SwiftUI app with ambiguous usage/purpose.

# Why

I'm a foolish and lazy developer that always want to build something but never start because I have no idea on what to build.
So now I'm trying to do an experiment on myself, start build anything without a single clear purpose, just do it.
The only main goal is I hope it will be an app that I will find it useful and will use it on daily basis.

# What

## Target platforms

I'm a iOS/iPadOS/macOS user, so this app will be target on the latest version of those platform.
